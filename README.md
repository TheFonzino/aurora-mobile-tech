## PC Repair & Mods

This git is for my personal business website, Aurora Mobile Tech. I will be adding multiple versions to remind myself of everything I learned during my time at college, mostly how to code properly.

The versions I will be making depend on the complexity of the website, with an HTML/CSS website to create a starting basis, and then a React/JS-based website where I can add more features and make it prettier than before.
