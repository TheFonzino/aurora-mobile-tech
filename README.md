## PC Repair & Mods

This git is for my personal business website, Aurora Mobile Tech. I will be adding multiple versions to remind myself of everything I learned during my time at NAIT, mostly how to code websites properly.

The versions I will be making depend on the complexity of the website:
- HTML/CSS website to create a starting basis
- React/JS-based website where I can add more features and make it prettier than before

I may also add in APIs and databases in the future to aid in making the website easier for customers to use and check the status of their repairs:
- Google Calendar API (to show my availability)
- Firebase or mySQL database (running on my server PC, logins and repair status)

There may also be a mobile app I create so that I can check everything on-the-go, which would be done using flutter and dart (possibly another using Rust, would have to learn from scratch. Never learned at NAIT)
